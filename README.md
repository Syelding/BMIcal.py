# BMI Calulator using Python

What is a BMI? Body Mass Index (BMI) is a personâ€™s weight in kilograms (or pounds) divided by the square of height in meters (or feet). A high BMI can indicate high body fatness. BMI screens for weight categories that may lead to health problems, but it does not diagnose the body fatness or health of an individual.

Knowing your BMI can help you start your fitness and health journey. I used python code to create a simple BMI calculator.
